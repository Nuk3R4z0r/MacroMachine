# SoundMachine
Soundboard for playing sounds. Can record by holding control and holding the binding you've set per sound.

This program was made with a virtual cable setup in mind.
It will work if your setup has the physical capabilities as well. 
I recommend VB-CABLE:
https://www.vb-audio.com/Cable/index.htm

Once VB-CABLE is installed, set your windows/app default recording device to "CABLE Output".
Set your Input device in SoundMachine to your usual recording device and the Playback device to "CABLE Input".

Settings, recordings and sounds are all saved to the users "My Documents\SoundMachine" folder.

Built using NAudio for playback and recording.
